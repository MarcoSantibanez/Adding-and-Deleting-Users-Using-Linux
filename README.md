In this project we were tasked with adding and deleting users for the company using linux. 


First, analyst added a new employee to the system and then to their primary group:

Second, made this employee the owner of a file related to a particular project:

Finally, deleted the employee from the system:

Being that when you create a new user in Linux, a group with the same name as the user is automatically created and the user is
the only member of that group. After removing users, it is good practice to clean up any such empty groups that may remain behind.
